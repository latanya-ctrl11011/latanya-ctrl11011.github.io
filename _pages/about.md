I am a third year undergraduate student at Howard University studying computer science on track to becoming a software engineer. Some things I have done to become more immersed into the tech field has been taking on leadership roles within my college, engaging in propgrams that build my technical skills, and building up my work experience. 

So far as an undergrad, I have taken on positions such as Secretary of the Google Developers Student Club, Logistics Lead of our Tech for Change chapter, and Social Programs Coordinator within my college's student council. Within these roles, I have had a chance to access technical interview prep resources, curate events for students within the engineering and computer science departments, and attend hackathons to showcase my public speaking, research, web-building, and coding skills.

As a current summer research intern at UC San Diego under the Summer Training Academy for Research Success (STARS) program, I am working closely with [Dr. Munyaka](https://www.imanimunyaka.com/) and [Mya Bolds](https://grad.ucsd.edu/diversity/programs-resources/ucem/sloan-scholars-pages/2022-sloan-scholars/bolds-mya.html) under the Android and DEI Statements projects.
